## Music player

!!! note "Keep in mind"

    - Allowed Roles/Channels will automatically ignore all other roles/channels, so you can and must not set both Allowed and Disabled Roles/Channels.
    - When editing the settings for the entire category, the settings will save to each individual command and NOT to the category settings selector itself.
    - Users with a `Disc Jokey` role will override these additional permissions, but `Moderators` will not.

!!! info inline "Usage keys"

    - The `[` and `]` around the argument means it’s **required**.
    - The `(` and `)` around the argument means it’s **optional**.
