**The bot is responding, but I can't hear it play music?**

Make sure MusicCat is not muted for you by right clicking it in your voice channel. If it is not muted then try changing the voice region in Server Settings (you can change it right back).This will reset the voice connection to discord servers which may be wonky at times.

If that doesn't resolve your issue, you can also try issuing the `/leave` and `/join` command.
